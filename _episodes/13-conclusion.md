We've seen how we can use version control to:

* Keep track of changes like a lab notebook for code and documents.
* Roll back changes to any point in the history of changes to our files - "undo" and
  "redo" for files.
* Back up our entire history of changes in various locations.
* Work on our files from multiple locations.
* Identify and resolve conflicts when the same file is edited within two
  repositories without losing any work.
* Collaboratively work on code or documents or any other files.

Now, consider again our initial scenario:

If someone asks you, "Can you process a new data file in exactly the same
way as described in your journal paper? Or can I have the code to do it myself?"
You can use your version control logs and tags to easily retrieve the exact
version of the code that you used.

Version control serves as a log book for your software and documents, ideas
you've explored, fixes you've made, refactorings you've done, false paths
you've explored - what was changed, who by, when and why - with a powerful undo
and redo feature!

It also allows you to work with others on a project, whether that be writing
code or papers, down to the level of individual files, without the risk of
overwriting and losing each others work, and being able to record and
understand who changed what, when, and why.

It's good to know how things can be improved.
